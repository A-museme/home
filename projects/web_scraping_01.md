## Overview
Developed a system using web scraping frameworks and public data sets to enhance sales datasets by identifying potential customers who had already adopted similar technologies or services. This enabled highly targeted sales efforts, improving conversion rates and accelerating growth for the business.

## Key Features
- **Targeted Data Collection:** Scraped relevant data from public websites, online forums, and industry-specific directories to identify companies or individuals using comparable technology.
- **Automated Lead Generation:** Used automated scraping scripts to continuously update the sales database with fresh, qualified leads that fit the target customer profile.
- **Data Enrichment:** Augmented existing sales datasets with additional information such as contact details, company size, market focus, and technology adoption level.
- **CRM Integration:** Automatically fed the enriched data into the CRM, enabling the sales team to prioritize high-potential leads.

## Process

### Research & Planning
- Identified public data sources, industry-specific directories, forums, and social media platforms where potential adopters of the targeted technology were active.
- Defined the criteria for qualifying leads (e.g., companies using certain technologies, discussing specific pain points), focusing on the types of customers most likely to adopt our offerings.
- Created a strategy to integrate web scraping into the existing sales pipeline, ensuring seamless CRM updates and lead prioritization.

### Development
- **Web Scraping Framework Setup:** Set up the project using Node.js and the Puppeteer library for browser automation. Puppeteer allowed dynamic web scraping by simulating real user interactions, bypassing obstacles like infinite scrolling or JavaScript-heavy websites.
- **Cheerio for Static Scraping:** For simpler websites, integrated Cheerio, which provided a lightweight, fast solution for extracting data from static HTML pages.
- **Public Data Sources:** Scraped public databases (e.g., technology adoption directories, online technology forums) to identify companies using or discussing similar solutions.
- **Data Structuring:** Parsed and structured the scraped data (e.g., company name, contact info, industry) into a format that could be easily analyzed and integrated into our sales pipeline.
- **Data Enrichment:** Used the scraped data to augment existing sales datasets with new information such as technology stack, recent acquisitions of comparable tools, and financial details.

### Automation & Data Augmentation
- **Continuous Data Collection:** Scheduled regular scraping tasks using Node.js to ensure the lead database stayed up-to-date. Data from relevant websites and directories was automatically pulled into the system on a set schedule.
- **API Integration:** Used APIs from public datasets to further enrich the data, retrieving additional details like market segment and company growth trends. This data was cross-referenced with the scraped results to ensure accuracy.
- **Lead Qualification:** Applied a custom qualification algorithm to rank leads based on their relevance and likelihood to adopt the technology, allowing the sales team to focus on high-value opportunities.

### CRM Integration
- Integrated the enriched datasets directly into the CRM, using custom API endpoints to push data into specific fields (e.g., lead name, technology stack, industry).

This project not only streamlined the lead generation process but also provided valuable insights to enhance our sales strategies, resulting in measurable growth and improved conversion rates.
